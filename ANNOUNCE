This version includes the following bug fixes and features:

1. Fixed problem with "use strict" and file uploads (thanks to Peter Haworth)
2. Fixed problem with not MSIE 3.01 for the power_mac not doing
      file uploads right.
3. Fixed problem with file upload on IIS 4.0 when authorization in
      use.
4. -content_type and '-content-type' can now be provided to
      header() as synonyms for -type.
5. CGI::Carp now escapes the ampersand BEFORE escaping the &gt; and
      &lt; signs.
6. Fixed "not an array reference" error when passing a hash
      reference to radio_group().

      occurs when server runs on non-C drive (thanks to Steve Kilbane
      for finding this one).
