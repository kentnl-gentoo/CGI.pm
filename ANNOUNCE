CGI.pm version 2.54 is now available for your fun and edification.
This will be the last version of the monolithic CGI.pm module.

The new version, 3.0, will be fully modularized and optimized for
faster loading and execution (thanks to a comprehensive rewrite by
David James).

Fixes in this version:

1. Removed automatic domain name addition from CGI::Cookie.  This will
BREAK some versions of Internet Explorer, but will fix problems that
arise in internal networks when the host table-based domain names are
not fully qualified.  To avoid breaking browsers, ALWAYS use the
-domain argument when creating cookies -- and fix your host tables!

2. Fixed problems in escape() handling of + signs.

3. Improvements to CGI::Pretty from Brian Paulsen (*not* regression
tested).
