CGI.pm version 2.47 is now available for your fun and edification.
This version includes the following bug fixes and features:

1. Patch to fix file upload bug appearing in IE 3.01 for Macintosh/PowerPC.

2.Replaced use of $ENV{SCRIPT_NAME} with $ENV{REQUEST_URI} when running
  under Apache, to fix self-referencing URIs.

3. Fixed bug in escapeHTML() which caused certain constructs, such as
   CGI->image_button(), to fail.

4. Fixed bug which caused strong('CGI') to fail.  Be careful to use
   CGI::strong('CGI') and not CGI->strong('CGI').  The latter will
   produce confusing results.

5. Added upload() function, as a preferred replacement for
   the "filehandle as string" feature.

6. Added cgi_error() error-reporting function.

7. Rewrote file upload handling to return undef rather than dieing
   when an error is encountered.  Be sure to call
   cgi_error() to find out what went wrong.
