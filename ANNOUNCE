CGI.pm version 2.68 is now available for your fun and edification.
The new version, 3.0, will be fully modularized and optimized for
faster loading and execution (thanks to a comprehensive rewrite by
David James).  See http://stein.cshl.org/WWW/software/CGI for a sneak peek.  

It should be released "any day now".
